Do you want to talk about it? I am here when you are ready.
What can I do to help today?
Just think happy thoughts.
Everything will be OK, I promise.
You just need to snap out of this.
You are not alone. I may not understand exactly how you feel, but you are not alone.
You are important to me.
That sounds like it is really hard. How are you coping?
I am really sorry you are going through this. I am here for you if you need me.
Have you spoken to your doctor or therapist about how you are feeling?
This must be hard for you, but you are going to get through it.
Talk to me. I am listening.
You do not need to do anything that makes you uncomfortable
Take as long as you need
Do you want some space?
You are a good person
It is not your fault
You are not a burden
I am not going to leave/abandon you
Do you want a hug?
I understand your pain and I empathize
