I feel ya!
Sometimes the best thing to do is to do nothing.
Life is the way it is! You just need the energy and the confidence to work through it.
The hard times always pass, you just need to hold on!
Always remember that every dark cloud has a silver lining!
If you need any help never fear to ask out to your peers
Try to be more involved with people around you! Communication is the solution to 99% of problems we face.
Thats sad to hear.
No one can help you if you dont help yourself! Pick yourself up, dust yourself off and continue with confidence.
Life can be so much more better if you have a positive outlook and dont worry about trivial matters..
Try to get some fresh air. In this lockdown people have been stewing too much alone with their thoughts which mostly has a negative effect on the mind
Always try to remain positive no matter what. Anger, Fear, Sadness are just negative elements which have no use in our life. Just get rid of them!
Live life to the fullest no matter what! Just forget everything and get rid of negative thoughts.
