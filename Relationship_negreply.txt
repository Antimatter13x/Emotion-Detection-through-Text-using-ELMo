I'm sure you will feel better, you just have to clear your mind for awhile.
I'm so sorry to hear that, just hold on to your hopes.
I think you deserve more than this. For what's your worth, there are actually plenty of fish in the sea!
Oh c'mon, we both know you are better than this...
Perhaps this is indication that he/she isn't the one for you
Every relationship is an experience. It's ok if it didn't last or didn't go the way you wanted it to 'cause you got something important out of it; lessons that ultimately make you a better version of yourself
A relationship involves people, not just you. So this isn't just about your wants, your needs and your dreams. Maybe it's time to stop being selfish
You gave your everything. You tried your best to salvage what you had. You did your part. But you can't make your partner do the same. Maybe it's time to move on to someone who's as invested as you are.  
If all your getting out of this is the feel that you don't matter, it doesn't mean that you actually don't. Your worthelss just to this one person while there's a whole world out there waiting to be discovered.
Having problems? Sit down together, take a deep breath and just talk it out. Be honest, don't hide a thing. You'll be surprised at how quickly your problems will disappear.
It's ok if they said no. At least 10 years down the line you won't be looking back wishing you'd expressed yourself and wondering what would have happened. 
People can't be controlled. The most you can do is be true and love them with all your heart. You can't expect them to do the same.
It's ok if they don't like you back. You can still stand back and watch over them, do everything you can to make them happy and be there for them when they need a little help. 
Isn't it better to hear 'no' now than to spend a valuable portion of your life thinking about the wrong person?
