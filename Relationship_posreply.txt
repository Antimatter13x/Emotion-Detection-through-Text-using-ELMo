You should definitely stay together!

I hope you stay as happy and satisfied forever as you are now
Happy to know that you have found your special person :)
Seems like you have a very understanding companion! Looks like there won't be much need for me lmao
Love is what we live for and as long as you have that, no type of bad feelings can affect you!
You are a good person and I hope your partner makes you even better and you them.
That's it, all you must do from now on is create memories, good and bad, through thick and thin, stick with them!
Glad that you are happy, don't get ahead of yourself! Focus on strengthening your relationship even further, do nice things!
